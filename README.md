# Digital Signal Processing Project

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive Digital Signal Processing (DSP) project implemented using MATLAB. The project demonstrates the application of various DSP techniques to analyze, process, and visualize signals for real-world scenarios.

## Features
- **Signal Filtering**: Implementations of FIR and IIR filters for noise reduction and signal enhancement.
- **Frequency Domain Analysis**: Fourier Transform (FFT) and spectral analysis are used to identify signal components.
- **Signal Visualization**: Interactive visualizations of time-domain and frequency-domain signals.
- **Custom Algorithms**: Development of unique signal compression and feature extraction algorithms.
- **Real-World Applications**: Applications in audio signal processing, communication systems, and biomedical signals.
